# Logitech-R6-LUA-Script
This little project of mine is a script written for the Logitech G HUB software to adjust recoil for any gun in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. This script is written in a way so that anyone can see exactly what they are adjusting with their recoil and in a super simple way. PLEASE go and read the "README" file to understand more.
